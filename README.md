<h2> SELF LEARNING </h2><br>

<br>
<h2 id="#introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>I have built this app specially for experiencing new features. Where I can show my skills to the employers. I have used firebase as my remote server. This app works perfectly. There is no errors or bugs. Just color combiantion is bad here. I did not use built in navgiation bar activity. I have built this drawer with custom code. Image sliders works perfectly. They retrieve the images from firbase source. Images change itself after 3 secs. I have done otp feature to verify phone number and notification send feature to send notifation to the users with images aded in the notification. Thank you.

 <h2 id="#technology">3. Technology</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Technology Stack:</strong></p>
<p>I have used Android studio 4.2.2 . Which is the latest version of android studio. Android studio is one of the most popular and a complete software to build android applications. For my Front end I decided to use xml to design my front end. For backend I decided to use java programming language. And for database I decided to use Firebase.</p>
