<h2> SELF LEARNING </h2><br>

<br>
<h2 id="#introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>I have built an app specially for faculty members. Where a faculty can manage his students data. A faculty is a very busy person so I think this app will help them to manage their students. They can keep track of their student’s data. They will be able to update data on regular basis. There is a database where I created a lot of data table (Faculty table, student table, etc.). A data table to keep Faculty’s username and password to login. And a data table to keep students data like F.name, L.name, Id, PhoneNo, etc. And a data table to keep data on regular basis like exam’s marks. At the start of a semester a faculty member will be given a section on his particular subject. In a section there will be 40 students. And throughout the semester the faculty have to upload regular data like Quiz-I marks, Quiz-II marks, MID marks, Final Marks. At the end of the table there will be a column for total marks and Final Grade. Grade will be on a university’s grading policy (ex- North South University).

 <h2 id="#technology">3. Technology</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Technology Stack:</strong></p>
<p>I proposed to Build mark sheet app by using Android studio 4.0.1 . Which is the latest version of android studio. Android studio is one of the most popular and a complete software to build android applications. For my Front end I decided to use xml to design my front end. For backend I decided to use java programming language. And for database I decided to use SQLiteOpenHelper to build database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Implemented Technology Stack:</strong></p>
<p>For user interface I used the built in feature of android studio. I used Android Studio 4.0.1 . I used Java Programming language as my backend. Where all logical condition was running. For database I used built-in database method. I used SQLiteOpenHelper to write queries of SQL. I used xml to design my activities. I used Intents to connect my activity to activity. And Used 100% of Java programming language at the backend.</em></p>

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
<p id="#conclusion">
Marksheet App is basically made for the faculty members. Where the faculty members will be able to use by username password verification. Their data will be protected with most security.
